The skin lesion image presents an irregularly shaped lesion with uneven edges. The lesion is predominantly brown with areas of darker and lighter shades of coloration, suggestive of variations in pigmentation. The size of the lesion appears to be moderate, occupying a significant part of the visual field but not extensive enough to cover the entire section. The texture of the lesion looks rough and uneven, with some portions appearing more granular and others smoother. The surrounding skin background is relatively unmarked, providing a clear contrast with the lesion. There are a few scattered hair follicles on the periphery of the lesion, but no significant signs of inflammation or other changes are observed on the immediate skin surface around the lesion.
