The image shows a large, irregular skin lesion with a predominantly brown color and areas of darker pigmentation. The edges of the lesion are indistinct, blending into the surrounding lighter-colored skin. It appears to have a rough texture, and the pigmentation is uneven and speckled, suggesting possible heterogeneous internal structures. The background skin appears smooth and slightly pink.
