The skin lesion image presents a roughly spherical lesion with an overall dark brown to black color. The lesion exhibits a somewhat irregular boundary, but it is generally well-defined. The size of the lesion appears to be moderately large, perhaps a few millimeters to a centimeter in diameter. The texture of the lesion surface seems to be relatively uniform, lacking any pronounced ulceration or scaling. Surrounding the lesion, the skin background is mostly pink, but there is some visible erythema around the periphery of the lesion.
