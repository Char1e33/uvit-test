The skin lesion in the image is irregularly shaped and measures approximately several millimeters in diameter. The main color of the lesion is brown, with areas of varying pigmentation ranging from light to dark brown. The texture appears uneven and somewhat granular. The surrounding skin background is light pink, with some areas showing slight erythema (redness). The edges of the lesion are not well defined, blending into the surrounding skin, but there is a distinct border where the pigmentation is denser. The overall appearance suggests variability in the lesion's depth and consistency of the pigmented areas.
