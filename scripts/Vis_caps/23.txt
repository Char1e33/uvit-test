The borders of the lesion appear well-defined and sharply demarcated from the surrounding skin. The diameter of the lesion is approximately 10-15 mm, which might be considered larger. The surrounding skin background is relatively even in tone, with a pinkish undertone, possibly indicating mild erythema. No visible inflammation or distinct pattern features are observed around the lesion.
